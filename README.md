# Splay Network: Advanced Wildlife Monitoring & Simulation

This project implements a cohesive system that combines **Splay Network Algorithms** for efficient sensor communication with **Real-Time AI Computer Vision** for wildlife tracking. It is designed to simulate a high-tech conservation network where "Edge Nodes" (sensors) capture low-resolution data, and a central "Server" restores and analyzes it.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Splay Network Simulation (The Backbone)
- **Dynamic Clustering**: Visualizes how sensor nodes self-organize into clusters to save energy.
- **Splay-Tree Optimization**: Uses splay algorithms to determine optimal routing paths to the gateway.
- **Energy Modeling**: Simulates battery drain (green -> yellow -> red -> dead) and tracks network lifespan.
- **Live Dashboard**: Monitors network health, tracking active vs. dead nodes and downtime.

### 2. AI Wildlife Analytics (The Intelligence)
- **Simulated Edge-to-Server Pipeline**:
    - **Edge Step**: Takes raw video frames and downscales them to 128px "thumbnails" (mimicking low-bandwidth transmission).
    - **Restoration Step**: Uses **SwinIR** (simulated) on the server to upconvert thumbnails back to 640px.
- **Object Detection**: Utilizing **YOLOv8** (Nano) to identify animals in the restored feed.
- **Tracking**: Implementing **DeepSORT** to assign unique IDs to animals and track their movement across frames.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Live Demo (Hugging Face)
This project is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for high-performance AI inference.
